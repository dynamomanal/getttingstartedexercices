/*
Names: Store the names of a few of your friends in a array called names. Print each person’s name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time.

Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
